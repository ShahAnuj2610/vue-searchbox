## Initial setup

Currently the initial setup is a bit manual which we're planning to improve.

1. Fork the repo in order to send PRs

2. Clone the repo from your profile, use SSH if possible

3. `cd` into the project directory

4. Checkout the `master` branch (should be default)

5. You can then install the dependencies, we recommend `yarn`. Run this from the project root:

```bash
yarn
```

6. You can run the following command from root which will start the watcher. This will let you make changes to these projects on the fly and the files will be transpiled and updated instantly:
```bash
yarn watch
```

7. You can run the `test-example` by going inside `test-example` directory and run the following command:
```bash
yarn && yarn serve
```

8. You can also test using `storybook`, by going inside `test-example` directory and run:
```bash
yarn storybook
```
